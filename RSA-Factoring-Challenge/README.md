# RSA Factoring Challenge
# General
### This is a challenge to try RSA, the public-key cryptosystem that
is widely used for secure data transmission.
### The codes provided will test a given set of numbers, for, presumably, encrytion
and decryption.

Factorize as many numbers as possible into a product of two smaller numbers.

## Description
    factors - the program to factorize (Usage: time ./factors tests/test00)
    tests/test00 - the file with the numbers
