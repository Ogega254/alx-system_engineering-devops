# 0x16. API advanced
# Learning Objectives
* At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

## General
* How to read API documentation to find the endpoints re looking for
* How to use an API with pagination
* How to parse JSON results from an API
* How to make a recursive API call
* How to sort a dictionary by value

# Requirements
## General
* Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
* All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.4.3)
* All your files should end with a new line
* The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
* Libraries imported in your Python files must be organized in alphabetical order
* A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
* Your code should use the PEP 8 style
* All your files must be executable
* The length of your files will be tested using wc
* All your modules should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
* You must use the Requests module for sending HTTP requests to the Reddit API

## Tests

* [tests](./tests): Folder of test files for all tasks. Provided by Holberton
School.

## Function Prototypes :floppy_disk:

Prototypes for functions written in this project:

| File           | Prototype                               |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `0-subs.py`    | `def number_of_subscribers(subreddit)`  |
| `1-top_ten.py` | `def top_ten(subreddit)`                |
| `2-recurse.py` | `def recurse(subreddit, hot_list=[])`   |
| `100-count.py` | `def count_words(subreddit, word_list)` |

## Tasks :page_with_curl:

* **0. How many subs?**
  * [0-subs.py](./0-subs.py): Python function that returns the total number of
  subscribers for a given subreddit.
  * Returns `0` if an invalid subreddit is given.

* **1. Top Ten**
  * [1-top_ten.py](./1-top_ten.py): Python function that prints the top ten
  hottest posts for a given subreddit.
  * Prints `None` if an invalid subreddit is given.

* **2. Recurse it!**
  * [2-recurse.py](./2-recurse.py): Python function that recursively returns a
  list of titles for all hot articles on a given subreddit.
  * Returns `None` if no results are found on the given subreddit.

* **3. Count it!**
  * [100-count.py](./100-count.py): Python function that recursively prints a
  sorted count of given keywords parsed from titles of all hot articles on a given
  subreddit.
  * Keywords are case-insensitive and delimited by spaces.
  * Results are printed in descending order by count.
  * Words with identical counts are sorted alphabetically.
  * Words with no matches are skipped.
  * Results are based on the number of times a keyword appears - ie.,
  `java java java` counts as three separate instances of `java`.
